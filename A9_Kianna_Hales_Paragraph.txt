Comparing New York and Chicago

Chicago, IL
Kianna Hales


I looked at Chicago, IL and neighboring areas (including Illinois and Wisconsin). 
Comparing all neighboring sampling locations, Chicago has the earliest average 
sampling date. Chicago reported clades 20C, 20A, 19B and a sliver of 19A. Milwaukee 
reported mostly 19A with some 20A and 20C. Madison reported 20A and 20C. Outside of 
Chicago, it seems that there are few neighboring spots that have clade 19B. 
Similarly, there are few spots outside of Milwaukee that have clade 19A. I was also 
interested in comparing Chicago to other major cities. First, I compared Chicago to 
New York. There seems to be more clade diversity in Chicago than New York. New York is 
mostly 20C and 20A, with a sliver of 19A. Chicago has 20C, 20A, 19B and a sliver of 19A. 
Chicago also has an earlier average sampling date than New York, which may have impacted 
the diversity captured. Chicago also had an earlier average sample data than New Orleans, 
San Diego, and the Bay Area. New Orleans is almost exclusively 20C, San Diego maintains a 
high level of diversity, with 20C taking the majority. Lastly, the Bay Area is one of the 
most diverse locations with mostly 20c and 19B, but all other clades still represented. 
Interestingly, just south of the bay area is a high concentration of 19A.
